# Java Pathfinding Project using Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm in Java that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between a set of 33 locations in the Hamra District. The aim is to provide an efficient way to navigate through the area's interconnected points.

## Features
- Calculates the shortest path between locations using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Visual representation of the graph of locations
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting starting and ending locations
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis

## Technologies
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for this project
- **Graph Data Structure**: Used to represent the locations and paths
- **JavaFX**: For creating interactive UI elements (if applicable)
- **JUnit**: For unit testing the algorithm and functionalities

## Algorithm Details
Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. In this project, we model the Hamra District with nodes representing locations and weighted edges representing the distances between them. The algorithm efficiently navigates through these nodes to determine the optimal path from a starting point to a destination.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
