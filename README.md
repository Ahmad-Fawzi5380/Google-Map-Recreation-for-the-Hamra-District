# Java Pathfinding Project using Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm in Java that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between a set of 33 locations in the Hamra District. This was made as my final project of my Algorithms and Data Structure class.

## Features
- Calculates the shortest path between locations using Dijkstra's algorithm
- List of the locations and the different routes linking them

## Language and Data Structures
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for this project
- **Graph Data Structure**: Used to represent the locations and paths

## Algorithm Details
Dijkstra's algorithm is the algorythm used in this program. It takes the starting point provided by the user and from it determines the shortest path to all other points on the map. The program then returns the path to the destiation, also provided by the user.

## How to Run
Copy the code provided in the repository into any compiler.

## Code Structure
- `src/`: Contains all source files
- `lib/`: Any dependency libraries used
- `README.md`: This file
